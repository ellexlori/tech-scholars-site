    <h2>A Quick Lesson on Equality</h2>
    <br>
    <div>
      <h3 class="learnh2">Equality Versus Inequality</h3>
      <p>The difference between equality and inequality is quite simple. Equality is the state of being equal or
        balanced.
        Inequality is the state of being unequal or unbalanced.</p>
      <p>Inequality has been going on for years in the government. One of the many examples being the right to vote for
        women (The Women's Suffrage Movement.)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="learnh2">Solving the Formula</h3>
      <p>The inequality that we face in our governments are the same as the ones we face in our math problems.</p>
      <p>Just like in math, the way to solve an inequality is by simplifying the inequality until you are left with a
        variable on its own.</p>
      <p>So based off this knowledge, the new question is: How can we solve problems a problem like inequality?</p>
      <p>One of the more complicated or specific answer is increase the minimum wage, expand the Earned Income Tax,
        build
        assets for working families, invest in education, make the tax code more progressive, and end residential
        segregation.</p>
      <p>One of the simplest or easy-to-achieve answer is by making everyone feel equal and have the same privileges in
        your school or office.</p>

    <h2 id="indexWSM">The Women's Suffrage Movement</h2>
  <br>
    <div>
      <h3 class="wsmh3">What Was The Women's Suffrage Movement?</h3>
      <p>The Women's Suffrage Movement was a fight for the right to vote. At the time, many opposed giving women the
        privilege to vote for a couple of reasons. Some worried about the anticorruption efforts of women. Others
        worried that women voters would support minimum wage and child labor laws. Most actually beleived that women
        were supposed to stay as homemakers and mothers and not politically active citizens. Nevertheless, women still
        fought and soon began to gain national support by the 1890s. </p>

      <p>Not all women wanted the vote, and many vehemently fought against suffrage.</p>

      <h3 class="wsmh4" class="list">Adding to the Arguement</h3>
