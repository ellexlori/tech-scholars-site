<h2 class="learnh2">Equality Versus Inequality</h2>
<p>The difference between equality and inequality is quite simple. Equality is the state of being equal or balanced. Inequality is the state of being unequal or unbalanced.</p>
<p>Inequality has been going on for years in the government. One of the many examples being the right to vote for women (The Women's Suffrage Movement.)</p>

<h2 class="learnh2">Solving the Formula</h2>
<p>The inequality that we face in our governments are the same as the ones we face in our math problems.</p>
<p>Just like in math, the way to solve an inequality is by simplifying the inequality until you are left with a variable on its own.</p>
<p>So based off this knowledge, the new question is: How can we solve problems a problem like inequality?</p>
<p>One of the more complicated or specific answer is increase the minimum wage, expand the Earned Income Tax, build assets for working families, invest in education, make the tax code more progressive, and end residential segregation.</p>
<p>One of the simplest or easy-to-achieve answer is by making everyone feel equal  and have the same privileges in your school or office.</p>
